a helper class to allow drag and drop functionality for an Esri Map control

started off from [this stellar sample](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/jssamples/exp_dragdrop.html) and went a bit crazy from there

you can drag and drop an Image, a CSV file, a URL to a Map, Feature or Image Service or an ArcGIS Server REST Query URL

check the [docs](https://github.com/adamjpfister/drag-drop-map-js/wiki/Documentation) and the [sample usage](https://github.com/adamjpfister/drag-drop-map-js/wiki/Sample-Usage) for more info
